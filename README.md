# [Exercise] Branching Logic In Java

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Create a class with overloaded constructors and multiple methods
* Write conditional statements using conditional and logical operators
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/branching-in-java-branching-logic-in-java) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/branching-in-java-branching-logic-in-java.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/branching-in-java-branching-logic-in-java`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `Person` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

6. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all test (All in branching-in-java-branching-logic-in-java)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

7. If the tests pass, then you're done!
